# Project #1: Your first application

### Pitch
_Read the instructions_

An instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time to approve your project.

You will meet with an instructor for ~15 minutes to get your app idea approved. Be sure to sketch out a wireframe, pick out what API you want to use, and write out what features you will need to build in order to meet MVP and some stretch goal ideas before you meet with us! 

Start a repo and include the above information in the README.

### &#x1F534; Mandatory To Pass:
#### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

#### Your application must meet these requirements:

  1. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  2. Hosted on surge<br>
  3. Commits to github every day<br>
  4. A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

  1. Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM
  1. Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc). Use at least 3 media  queries
  1. ~~Have one or more complex user interface modules such as a carousel, drag and drop, a sticky nav, tooltips, etc~~

### ðŸ“‹ List of API's

Below is a non-exhaustive list of some free API's you can use. There are _many_ API's out there, however, so if you find one not on this list that you'd like to use, feel free! Please note that some may require signing up for an API key.

  1. Star Wars: https://swapi.co/
  1. Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api
  1. News: https://newsapi.org/
  1. Giphy: https://developers.giphy.com/
  1. Pokemon: http://pokeapi.co/
  1. Card Deck: https://deckofcardsapi.com/
  1. Google Books: https://developers.google.com/books/
  1. City of Chicago: https://data.cityofchicago.org/
  1. Beer: https://www.brewerydb.com/developers
  1. Chuck Norris: http://www.icndb.com/
  1. Rick and Morty: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest
  
Lastly, the following sites congregates a bunch of API's together, so you can take a look through their libraries and try to find an API that interests you! Note, however, that not all API's are free and many listed may require payment. We **highly suggest** to use a free API for your first project dealing with one.

  1. https://rapidapi.com/

### &#x1F535; Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):

- Look into [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so you can save data to the user's browser 
- Add a second API
- Add creative use of event listeners and ui interaction
- Konami code ;)
- Get feedback from UX student
- You can also host your projects with your own domain name. [Here is a walktrhough from namecheap, one web hosting service](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages)

## Make A New Repo

:heavy_exclamation_mark: You will be using GitHub, **not** GitHub Enterprise!

1. After your project has been approved, [make a new github repo for your project](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/). You will be deploying this project onto surge.


## Technical Demonstration

All projects will be presented to the class.  Your presentation should:

* Be approximately 5 minutes in length
* Show off all features of the app
* Explain the technical details
* Explain the technical challenges
* Explain which improvements you might make

You will be sharing your project and your code.  Be prepared to answer questions from the instructors and other students.
